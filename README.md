# 2022-Zoo-Biology-Husbandry-Report-Supplementary-Materials-Data-and-Code-Part2
More materials associated with the 2022 Zoo Biology Husbandry Report, namely all COLONY analyses (COLONY analyses in part 1 repository are all trial runs from 2018). All allele .fsa files (which can be read with Geneious) from various optimizations of fragment analyses are also included. People are invited to read these on Geneious if they want to look at how the fragments improved over time with optimizationâ€”-the best-amplified alleles tended to be visualized during the end of the optimization process in 2019 (worse fragments are from the beginning of optimization in 2018), and the best fragments were those I used to create bins for allele calling/genotyping. There may be duplicates allele .fsa files from the part 1 repository, but all files should be uploaded at least once in either repository.
